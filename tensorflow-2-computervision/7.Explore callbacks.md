# Explore callbacks

7. Explore callbacks
Earlier, when you trained for extra epochs, you had an issue where your loss might change. It might have taken a bit of time for you to wait for the training to do that and you might have thought that it'd be nice if you could stop the training when you reach a desired value, such as 95% accuracy. If you reach that after 3 epochs, why sit around waiting for it to finish a lot more epochs?

Like any other program, you have callbacks! See them in action:


import tensorflow as tf

class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
    if(logs.get('accuracy')>0.95):
      print("\nReached 95% accuracy so cancelling training!")
      self.model.stop_training = True

callbacks = myCallback()
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
training_images=training_images/255.0
test_images=test_images/255.0
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5, callbacks=[callbacks])
