# Design the model

Now design the model. You'll have three layers. Go through them one-by-one and explore the different types of layers and the parameters used for each.

```py
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), 
                                    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu), 
                                    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)])
```
Sequential defines a sequence of layers in the neural network.
Flatten takes a square and turns it into a one-dimensional vector.
Dense adds a layer of neurons.
Activation functions tell each layer of neurons what to do. There are lots of options, but use these for now:
Relu effectively means that if X is greater than 0 return X, else return 0. It only passes values of 0 or greater to the next layer in the network.
Softmax takes a set of values, and effectively picks the biggest one. For example, if the output of the last layer looks like [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 9.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], then it saves you from having to sort for the largest valueâ€”it returns [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].
