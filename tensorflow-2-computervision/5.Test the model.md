# Test the model

5. Test the model
How would the model perform on data it hasn't seen? That's why you have the test set. You call model.evaluate and pass in the two sets, and it reports the loss for each. Give it a try:


model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
And here's the output:


10000/10000 [=====] - 1s 56us/sample - loss: 0.3365 - acc: 0.8789
[0.33648381242752073, 0.8789]
That example returned an accuracy of .8789, meaning it was about 88% accurate. (You might have slightly different values.)

As expected, the model is not as accurate with the unknown data as it was with the data it was trained on! As you learn more about TensorFlow, you'll find ways to improve that.
