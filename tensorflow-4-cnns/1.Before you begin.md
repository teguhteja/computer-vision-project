# Before you begin

1. Before you begin
In this codelab, you'll learn to use CNNs to improve your image classification models.

Prerequisites
This codelab builds on work completed in two previous installments, Build a computer vision model, where we introduce some of the code that you'll use here, and the Build convolutions and perform pooling codelab, where we introduce convolutions and pooling.

What you'll learn
How to improve computer vision and accuracy with convolutions
What you'll build
Layers to enhance your neural network
What you'll need
You can find the code for the rest of the codelab running in Colab.

You'll also need TensorFlow installed, and the libraries you installed in the previous codelab.
