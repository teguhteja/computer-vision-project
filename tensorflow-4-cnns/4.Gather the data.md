# Gather the data

4. Gather the data
The first step is to gather the data.

You'll notice that there's a change here and the training data needed to be reshaped. That's because the first convolution expects a single tensor containing everything, so instead of 60,000 28x28x1 items in a list, you have a single 4D list that is 60,000x28x28x1, and the same for the test images. If you don't do that, then you'll get an error when training because the convolutions do not recognize the shape.


import tensorflow as tf
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
training_images=training_images.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1)
training_images = training_images/255.0
test_images = test_images.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)
test_images = test_images/255.0
