# Define the model

5. Define the model
Next, define your model. Instead of the input layer at the top, you're going to add a convolutional layer. The parameters are:

The number of convolutions you want to generate. A value like 32 is a good starting point.
The size of the convolutional matrix, in this case a 3x3 grid.
The activation function to use, in this case use relu.
In the first layer, the shape of the input data.
You'll follow the convolution with a max pooling layer, which is designed to compress the image while maintaining the content of the features that were highlighted by the convolution. By specifying (2,2) for the max pooling, the effect is to reduce the size of the image by a factor of 4. It creates a 2x2 array of pixels and picks the largest pixel value, turning 4 pixels into 1. It repeats this computation across the image, and in so doing halves the number of horizontal pixels and halves the number of vertical pixels.

You can call model.summary() to see the size and shape of the network. Notice that after every max pooling layer, the image size is reduced in the following way:

Here's the full code for the CNN:


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
#Add another convolution
tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
#Now flatten the output. After this you'll just have the same DNN structure as the non convolutional version
tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
#The same 128 dense layers, and 10 output layers as in the pre-convolution example:
tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
