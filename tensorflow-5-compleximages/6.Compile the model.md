# Compile the model

6. Compile the model
Next, configure the specifications for model training. Train your model with the binary_crossentropy loss because it's a binary classification problem and your final activation is a sigmoid. (For a refresher on loss metrics, see Descending into ML.) Use the rmsprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. During training, monitor classification accuracy.

Note: In this case, using the RMSprop optimization algorithm is preferable to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) because RMSprop automates learning-rate tuning for you. (Other optimizers, such as Adam and Adagrad, also automatically adapt the learning rate during training and would work equally well here.)


from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop
 
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer=RMSprop(lr=0.001),
              metrics=['acc'])
