# Use the ImageGenerator to label and prepare the data

3. Use the ImageGenerator to label and prepare the data
You do not explicitly label the images as horses or humans.

Later you'll see something called an ImageDataGenerator being used. It reads images from subdirectories and automatically labels them from the name of that subdirectory. For example, you have a training directory containing a horses directory and a humans directory. ImageDataGenerator will label the images appropriately for you, reducing a coding step.

Define each of those directories.


# Directory with our training horse pictures
train_horse_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/horse-or-human/horses')
 
# Directory with our training human pictures
train_human_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/horse-or-human/humans')
Now, see what the filenames look like in the horses and humans training directories:


train_horse_names = os.listdir(train_horse_dir)
print(train_horse_names[:10])
train_human_names = os.listdir(train_human_dir)
print(train_human_names[:10])
Find the total number of horse and human images in the directories:


print('total training horse images:', len(os.listdir(train_horse_dir)))
print('total training human images:', len(os.listdir(train_human_dir)))
