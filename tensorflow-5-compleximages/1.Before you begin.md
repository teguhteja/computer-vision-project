# Before you begin

1. Before you begin
In this codelab you'll use convolutions to classify images of horses and humans. You'll be using TensorFlow in this lab to create a CNN that is trained to recognize images of horses and humans, and classify them.

Prerequisites
If you've never built convolutions with TensorFlow before, you may want to complete Build convolutions and perform pooling codelab, where we introduce convolutions and pooling, and Build convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance computer vision, where we discuss how to make computers more efficient at recognizing images.

What you'll learn
How to train computers to recognize features in an image in which the subject isn't clear
What you'll build
A convolutional neural network that can distinguish between pictures of horses and pictures of humans
What you'll need
You can find the code for the rest of the codelab running in Colab.

You'll also need TensorFlow installed, and the libraries you installed in the previous codelab.
