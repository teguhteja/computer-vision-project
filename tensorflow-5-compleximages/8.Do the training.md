# Do the training

8. Do the training
Train for 15 epochs. (That may take a few minutes to run.)


history = model.fit(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=8,  
      epochs=15,
      verbose=1)
Note the values per epoch.

The Loss and Accuracy are a great indication of progress of training. It's making a guess as to the classification of the training data, and then measuring it against the known label, calculating the result. Accuracy is the portion of correct guesses.
