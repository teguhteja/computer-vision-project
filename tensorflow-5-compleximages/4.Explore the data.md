# Explore the data

4. Explore the data
Take a look at a few pictures to get a better sense of what they look like.

First, configure the matplot parameters:


%matplotlib inline
 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
 
# Parameters for our graph; we'll output images in a 4x4 configuration
nrows = 4
ncols = 4
 
# Index for iterating over images
pic_index = 0
Now, display a batch of eight horse pictures and eight human pictures. You can rerun the cell to see a fresh batch each time.


# Set up matplotlib fig, and size it to fit 4x4 pics
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.set_size_inches(ncols * 4, nrows * 4)
 
pic_index += 8
next_horse_pix = [os.path.join(train_horse_dir, fname) 
                for fname in train_horse_names[pic_index-8:pic_index]]
next_human_pix = [os.path.join(train_human_dir, fname) 
                for fname in train_human_names[pic_index-8:pic_index]]
 
for i, img_path in enumerate(next_horse_pix+next_human_pix):
  # Set up subplot; subplot indices start at 1
  sp = plt.subplot(nrows, ncols, i + 1)
  sp.axis('Off') # Don't show axes (or gridlines)
 
  img = mpimg.imread(img_path)
  plt.imshow(img)
 
plt.show()
 
Here are some example images showing horses and humans in different poses and orientations:
