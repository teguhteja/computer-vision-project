# Getting Started: Acquire the data

2. Getting Started: Acquire the data
You'll do this by building a horses-or-humans classifier that will tell you if a given image contains a horse or a human, where the network is trained to recognize features that determine which is which. You'll have to do some processing of the data before you can train.

First, download the data:


!wget \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/learning-datasets/horse-or-human.zip \
  -O /tmp/horse-or-human.zip
The following Python code will use the OS library to use operating system libraries, giving you access to the file system and the zip file library, therefore allowing you to unzip the data.


import os
import zipfile
 
local_zip = '/tmp/horse-or-human.zip'
zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/horse-or-human')
zip_ref.close()
The contents of the zip file are extracted to the base directory /tmp/horse-or-human, which contain horses and human subdirectories.

In short, the training set is the data that is used to tell the neural network model that "this is what a horse looks like" and "this is what a human looks like."
