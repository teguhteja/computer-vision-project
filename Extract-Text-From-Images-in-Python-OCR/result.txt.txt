Instructions

On the following page is some text. To show the
text, click the mouse then begin to read as soon
as the text appears. After one minute a chime
will sound. Stop reading and note the number of
the line that you are on (located on the right).
That is your reading rate. Go to the next page
and answer some questions about what you
have read (without going back). Afterwards, go
to the final page for comments and tips about
reading.
