# Start coding

Start by importing some Python libraries and the ascent picture:


import cv2
import numpy as np
from scipy import misc
i = misc.ascent()
Next, use the Pyplot library matplotlib to draw the image so that you know what it looks like:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.grid(False)
plt.gray()
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(i)
plt.show()

You can see that it's an image of a stairwell. There are lots of features you can try and isolate. For example, there are strong vertical lines.

The image is stored as a NumPy array, so we can create the transformed image by just copying that array. The size_x and size_y variables will hold the dimensions of the image so you can loop over it later.


i_transformed = np.copy(i)
size_x = i_transformed.shape[0]
size_y = i_transformed.shape[1]
