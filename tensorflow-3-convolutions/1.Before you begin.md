# Before you begin
https://developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-3-convolutions#0

1. Before you begin
In this codelab, you'll learn about convolutions and why they are so powerful in computer vision scenarios.

In the previous codelab, you created a simple Deep Neural Network (DNN) for computer vision of fashion items. This was limited because it required the clothing item to be the only thing in the picture, and it had to be centered.

Of course, this isn't a realistic scenario. You'll want your DNN to be able to identify the clothing item in pictures with other objects, or where it isn't positioned front and center. To do this, you'll need to use convolutions.

Prerequisites
This codelab builds on work completed in two previous installments, Say hello to the "Hello, World" of machine learning, and Build a computer vision model. Please complete those codelabs before continuing.

What you'll learn
What are convolutions
How to create a feature map
What is pooling
What you'll build
A feature map of an image
What you'll need
You can find the code for the rest of the codelab running in Colab.

You'll also need TensorFlow installed, and the libraries you installed in the previous codelab.
