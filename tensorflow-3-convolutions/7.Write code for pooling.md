# Write code for pooling

7. Write code for pooling
The following code will show a (2, 2) pooling. Run it to see the output.

You'll see that while the image is one-fourth the size of the original, it kept all the features.


new_x = int(size_x/2)
new_y = int(size_y/2)
newImage = np.zeros((new_x, new_y))
for x in range(0, size_x, 2):
  for y in range(0, size_y, 2):
    pixels = []
    pixels.append(i_transformed[x, y])
    pixels.append(i_transformed[x+1, y])
    pixels.append(i_transformed[x, y+1])
    pixels.append(i_transformed[x+1, y+1])
    pixels.sort(reverse=True)
    newImage[int(x/2),int(y/2)] = pixels[0]
 
# Plot the image. Note the size of the axes -- now 256 pixels instead of 512
plt.gray()
plt.grid(False)
plt.imshow(newImage)
#plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

Note the axes of that plot. The image is now 256x256, one-fourth of its original size, and the detected features have been enhanced despite less data now being in the image.
