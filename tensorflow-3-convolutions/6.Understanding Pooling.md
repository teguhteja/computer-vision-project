# Understanding Pooling

6. Understanding Pooling
Now that you've identified the essential features of the image, what do you do? How do you use the resulting feature map to classify images?

Similar to convolutions, pooling greatly helps with detecting features. Pooling layers reduce the overall amount of information in an image while maintaining the features that are detected as present.

There are a number of different types of pooling, but you'll use one called Maximum (Max) Pooling.

Iterate over the image and, at each point, consider the pixel and its immediate neighbors to the right, beneath, and right-beneath. Take the largest of those (hence max pooling) and load it into the new image. Thus, the new image will be one-fourth the size of the old. Max Pooling
