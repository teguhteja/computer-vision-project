# Create the convolution matrix

4. Create the convolution matrix
First, make a convolution matrix (or kernel) as a 3x3 array:


# This filter detects edges nicely
# It creates a filter that only passes through sharp edges and straight lines. 
# Experiment with different values for fun effects.
#filter = [ [0, 1, 0], [1, -4, 1], [0, 1, 0]] 
# A couple more filters to try for fun!
filter = [ [-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]
#filter = [ [-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
 # If all the digits in the filter don't add up to 0 or 1, you 
# should probably do a weight to get it to do so
# so, for example, if your weights are 1,1,1 1,2,1 1,1,1
# They add up to 10, so you would set a weight of .1 if you want to normalize them
weight  = 1
Now, calculate the output pixels. Iterate over the image, leaving a 1-pixel margin, and multiply each of the neighbors of the current pixel by the value defined in the filter.

That means that the current pixel's neighbor above it and to the left of it will be multiplied by the top-left item in the filter. Then, multiply the result by the weight and ensure that the result is in the range 0 through 255.

Finally, load the new value into the transformed image:


for x in range(1,size_x-1):
  for y in range(1,size_y-1):
      output_pixel = 0.0
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x - 1, y-1] * filter[0][0])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x, y-1] * filter[0][1])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x + 1, y-1] * filter[0][2])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x-1, y] * filter[1][0])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x, y] * filter[1][1])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x+1, y] * filter[1][2])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x-1, y+1] * filter[2][0])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x, y+1] * filter[2][1])
      output_pixel = output_pixel + (i[x+1, y+1] * filter[2][2])
      output_pixel = output_pixel * weight
      if(output_pixel<0):
        output_pixel=0
      if(output_pixel>255):
        output_pixel=255
      i_transformed[x, y] = output_pixel
