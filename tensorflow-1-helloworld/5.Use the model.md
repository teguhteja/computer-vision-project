# Use the model

5. Use the model
You have a model that has been trained to learn the relationship between X and Y. You can use the model.predict method to have it figure out the Y for a previously unknown X. For example, if X is 10, what do you think Y will be? Take a guess before you run the following code:


print(model.predict([10.0]))
You might have thought 31, but it ended up being a little over. Why do you think that is?

Neural networks deal with probabilities, so it calculated that there is a very high probability that the relationship between X and Y is Y=3X+1, but it can't know for sure with only six data points. The result is very close to 31, but not necessarily 31.

As you work with neural networks, you'll see that pattern recurring. You will almost always deal with probabilities, not certainties, and will do a little bit of coding to figure out what the result is based on the probabilities, particularly when it comes to classification.
