# Train the neural network

4. Train the neural network
The process of training the neural network, where it learns the relationship between the X's and Y's, is in the model.fit call. That's where it will go through the loop before making a guess, measuring how good or bad it is (the loss), or using the optimizer to make another guess. It will do that for the number of epochs that you specify. When you run that code, you'll see the loss will be printed out for each epoch.


model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)
For example, you can see that for the first few epochs, the loss value is quite large, but it's getting smaller with each step.

As the training progresses, the loss soon gets very small.

By the time the training is done, the loss is extremely small, showing that our model is doing a great job of inferring the relationship between the numbers.

You probably don't need all 500 epochs and can experiment with different amounts. As you can see from the example, the loss is really small after only 50 epochs, so that might be enough!
