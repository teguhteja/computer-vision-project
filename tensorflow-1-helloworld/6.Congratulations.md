# Congratulations

6. Congratulations
Believe it or not, you covered most of the concepts in ML that you'll use in far more complex scenarios. You learned how to train a neural network to spot the relationship between two sets of numbers by defining the network. You defined a set of layers (in this case only one) that contained neurons (also in this case, only one), which you then compiled with a loss function and an optimizer.

The collection of a network, loss function, and optimizer handles the process of guessing the relationship between the numbers, measuring how well they did, and then generating new parameters for new guesses. Learn more at TensorFlow.org.
