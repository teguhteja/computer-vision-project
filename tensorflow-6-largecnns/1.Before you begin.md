# Before you begin

1. Before you begin
In this codelab, you'll learn to use CNNs with large datasets, which can help avoid the problem of overfitting.

Prerequisites
If you've never built convolutions with TensorFlow before, you may want to complete Build convolutions and perform pooling codelab, where we introduce convolutions and pooling, and Build convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance computer vision, where we discuss how to make computers more efficient at recognizing images.

What you'll learn
How to avoid overfitting
What you'll build
A CNN that is trained to recognize images of cats or dogs (based on an old Kaggle challenge).
What you'll need
You can find the code for the rest of the codelab running in Colab.

You'll also need TensorFlow installed, and the libraries you installed in the previous codelab.
