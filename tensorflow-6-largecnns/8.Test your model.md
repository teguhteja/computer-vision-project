# Test your model

8. Test your model
If you want to take the model for a spin, you can use the following code. Upload images to see how it classifies them!


# Here's a codeblock just for fun. You should be able to upload an image here 
# and have it classified without crashing
import numpy as np
from google.colab import files
from keras.preprocessing import image
 
uploaded = files.upload()
 
for fn in uploaded.keys():
 
  # predicting images
  path = '/content/' + fn
  img = image.load_img(path, target_size=(150, 150))
  x = image.img_to_array(img)
  x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
 
  images = np.vstack([x])
  classes = model.predict(images, batch_size=10)
  print(classes[0])
  if classes[0]>0.5:
    print(fn + " is a dog")
  else:
    print(fn + " is a cat")
